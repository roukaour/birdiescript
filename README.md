# BirdieScript

BirdieScript is a programming language designed for code golfâ€”writing programs in as few characters as possible. It is based on [GolfScript](http://www.golfscript.com/), but adds features like variable scoping and I/O, as well as a much larger standard library.

To install it, run `python setup.py install`. Then run `./birdiescript` for an interactive REPL environment, or `./birdiescript FILE` to execute `FILE` as BirdieScript code.

      -m DEPTH, --maxdepth DEPTH
                set maximum recursion depth
      -r, --repl            run as REPL environment
